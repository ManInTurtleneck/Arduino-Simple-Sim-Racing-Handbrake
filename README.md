# 🏎️ DIY Sim Racing Handbrake

I love sim racing but hate overspending.  
Most cheap handbrakes online go for **$100+** — despite being super simple and often poorly designed (buttons instead of potentiometers, too many screws, inconsistent parts).  

So, I designed my own: a **low-cost, 3D-printable handbrake** that’s easy to build, durable, and feels great.
